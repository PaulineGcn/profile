        <p>
          I am passionate about discovering new places around the world. Currently learning to code <a href="https://www.lewagon.com" target="_blank"> @Le Wagon</a> to become free with my time, strengthen my creativity and to develop my own projets and dreams. I plan to travel to Indonesia after this experience to mix code, discoveries & yoga. I want to share with you <strong>a bit of my passions</strong> in this page!

                <p>To get a good look at the Chapada Diamantina valley and all of its plateau glory, take the trail to Morro do Pai Inácio, which offers one of the best postcard views in the entire park. The trail is relatively easy to access and is located along the road BR-242, between the towns of Palmeiras and Lençóis. Be prepared for some inclines and steep hills and about a four- to five-hour hike each way.</p>

                <p>Antelope Canyon is one of the most famous and most photographed canyons on earth. You see it on magazine covers, posters and coffee table books. It is beautiful - you gasp with wonder when you see sunlight dancing on the canyon's sculpted walls.</p>

                <p>The Kilauea’iki trail will lead you through a lush ohia forest down into the Kilauea’iki crater, straight over the crater floor past warm and steaming fissures in the ground. The crater floor was formed almost 60 years ago, and the small ohia shrubs are only now starting to grow in the cracks of the solidified lava.</p>

                <p>What's so fabulous about Yosemite? It's got dozens of incomparable meadows and more than a hundred lakes, plus waterfalls as tall as a 200-story building, trees the size of rocket ships, mountains the size of - well, mountains - and even a few beaches.</p>
